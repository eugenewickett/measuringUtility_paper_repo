## Repoducibility repository for "Measuring sampling plan utility in post-marketing surveillance of medical products"
This repository generates synthetic data and figures for the JQT submission "Measuring sampling plan utility in post-marketing surveillance of medical products."
Syntethic data and accompanying figures and tables mirror the content and principles contained in the paper but do not exactly replicate what is shown with deidentified data.

ReproducibilityRepoPythonCode.py presents utility estimation, including accompanying
figures, for the example supply chain discussed in Section 4.3 of the article. All utility
estimates may take upwards of an hour to compute, depending on the computer's processing
power.

Computations require use of the logistigate package, available at https://github.com/eugenewickett/logistigate/.
